## Materials

- Here is a link to the manual for the [Zoom H5 recorder](https://www.zoom-na.com/sites/default/files/products/downloads/pdfs/E_H5_0.pdf)(pdf).

## Checklist for setting up your recorder before a recording session.
Each recorder is different. The best place to find out how to change the setting is the user manual that comes with the recorder. These are usually available online. 

Check these settings (before you record).
- Mono/Stereo
- Set to Wav not Mp3
- Bit rate (16 or 24)
- Sample rate 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz
- Check lo/cut filter (can be set to on if it is windy otherwise best left off)
- Check battery type (alkaline is non-rechargable and Ni-MH is a rechargable battery)


## Checklist for when you are ready to record
- Find a quiet place (listen out for background noises â€“ fans, aircon, trees, insects)  
- Place the recorder or external microphone (if you are using one) close but not too close to the speaker.
- Set the levels with the speaker in front of the microphone - set using the *input* volume not the output volume (this just changes what is in your headphones).
- Use headphones if you have them.
- Remember to press record!
